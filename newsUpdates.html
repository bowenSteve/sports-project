                <h2>Transfer Centre LIVE! Former Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri steps down as Lazio coach after three years in charge</h2>
                <img src="https://liveblog.digitalimages.sky/lc-images-sky/lcimg-ae3e8d57-f37a-410c-ab42-d54e6328971d.jpeg" alt="Image 1">
               
                <p>Maurizio Sarri has resigned from his role as Lazio coach and assistant coach Giovanni Martusciello has been nominated to lead the team, the Serie A club said on Wednesday.
    
                    "S.S. Lazio announces that Maurizio Sarri has handed in his resignation as head coach of the first team," the club said in a statement on Wednesday.
                    
                    "The club would like to thank the coach for his achievements and for the work he has done, wishing him the best of luck in his professional and personal life.
                    
                    "At the same time, the club communicates that it has decided to entrust Giovanni Martusciello with the technical leadership."
                    
                    The 65-year-old had handed his resignation to the club's management on Tuesday, the Italian media reported.
                    
                    Lazio, who on Monday suffered a 2-1 home defeat against Udinese, are ninth in the Serie A standings with 40 points from 28 games.
                    
                    They lost five of their last six games across all competitions.
                    
                    Former Chelsea and Napoli manager Sarri took over Lazio in June 2021 from Simone Inzaghi, who left to sign with Inter Milan.
                    
                    The club last Thursday dismissed media reports saying Lazio considered sacking Sarri after their 3-0 defeat at Bayern Munich in the Champions League, the result that saw them out of the competition, stressing that his contract was expiring in 2025.</p>

                <h2>Juventus among Serie A clubs interested in Ferguson</h2>

                <p>Serie A giants Juventus and Napoli are among a host of clubs interested in signing Scotland international Lewis Ferguson from Bologna this summer.

                    The 24-year-old has been a revelation since leaving Aberdeen for the Rossoblu in the summer of 2022 in a deal worth £3m - £2.1m up front and £900,000 in add-ons.
                    
                    That has proven to be a bargain move for the Serie A side so far, with Ferguson’s form already earning him a contract extension and the club captaincy. </p>

                <h2>Liverpool: Michael Edwards reaches agreement to return to FSG with ex-Bournemouth man Richard Hughes also set to join</h2>
                <img src="https://e0.365dm.com/21/11/1600x900/skysports-michael-edwards-liverpool_5578449.jpg?20211110164412" alt="Image 1">
               
                <p>Edwards, who previously worked as Liverpool's sporting director, has been appointed CEO of Football as Fenway Sports Group (FSG) - the company which owns Liverpool. He will take on Mike Gordon's responsibilities and will appoint a sporting director for Liverpool, with Hughes understood to have agreed to take on the role.

                    Hughes will be responsible for identifying and recruiting Jurgen Klopp's successor.Transfer Centre LIVE! Former Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri steps down as Lazio coach after three years in charge
                    
                    It is understood Edwards turned down numerous offers since his exit from Liverpool in 2022, including Manchester United and Chelsea. But Edwards has been persuaded to return to the Anfield club "in a role with greater seniority than he held previously and with a wider remit", according to FSG president Gordon. "It was clear when we initially reached out to him that a broader scope would be a key motivating factor for any potential return to the industry," he added. "In this regard - and many others - his ambitions matched ours."</p>

                <h2>Cancelo not wanting to return to Man City</h2>
                <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GIY82-oWYAEGKTo?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="Image 1">
                
                <p>Joao Cancelo has confirmed he hopes to see his loan move from Manchester City to Barcelona become permanent this summer.

                    The Portugal full-back found himself out of favour under Pep Guardiola last season before sealing a loan switch to the Catalan giants in September following an initial spell with Bayern Munich.
                    
                    In an interview with Italian publication Gazzetta dello Sport, the 29-year-old said: "Loan from Man City? I don’t know my future yet but I’d like to stay at Barcelona.
                    
                    “I grew up with Ronaldinho as idol, I’m proud to wear Barça shirt."</p>
